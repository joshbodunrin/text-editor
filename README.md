# text-editor
Trying to create text editor from scratch. still deciding between c and c++


Later Update:
Decided to just do up to text viewer part of tutorial. Lost interest in this project. Did enought to learn basics of C and was satisfied. Now want to work on other projcets that interst me more with newfound knowledge.
May go back and finish one day

Would recommend following this tutorial if intersted in learning some. Has good notes and easy to follow along:
